## TESO Cartographer
Interactive maps of TESO ([The Elder Scrolls Online](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/)) locations for web browser.

* Map itself is made with [Folium library](https://pypi.org/project/folium/) (Leaflet.js)
* Coordinates is extracted from [MapPins addon](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1881-MapPins.html), used without changes
* Maps and icons is extracted directly from game files with [EsoExtractData addon](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1258-EsoExtractData.html) and proceeded by me
